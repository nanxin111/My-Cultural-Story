Long ago, the sky was torn apart, and chaos spread across the world.
Floods and fire threatened all living beings, and the balance of nature was broken.
You play as Nüwa, a goddess who takes responsibility for restoring harmony.
To repair the sky, you must travel through dangerous lands, overcome obstacles, and collect the five-colored stones.
Each stone represents one of the five elements of the universe:
Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth.
Only by gathering all five elements and placing them back into the sky can balance be restored and the world healed.


- Use the LEFT and RIGHT arrow keys to move Nüwa.
- Press UP to jump onto platforms.
- Avoid monsters, or you will lose health.
- Collect all five-colored stones hidden throughout the level.
- Once all stones are collected, a door will appear.
- Enter the door to reach the Sky Repair Stage.
- In the final stage, drag and place each elemental stone into the broken sky.
- When all five stones are placed correctly, the sky will be repaired, and you will win the game.


You've collected 5 elements. Now drag them to the sky hole
to repair the world! Press ENTER to continue...


With the five-colored stones returned to the sky, balance is restored.
The opening in the sky slowly closes, and calm returns to the world.
Floods recede, fires fade, and life begins to flourish once more.
The land breathes again, not because of force, but because of care and perseverance.
Nüwa’s journey comes to an end, but the lesson remains.
Harmony is not something that happens on its own.
It is created through responsibility, patience, and respect for the natural world.
You have helped restore balance.
The world endures because of your actions.
